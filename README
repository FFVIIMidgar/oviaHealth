This is a basic structure for a hotel booking system. To run this environment I
recommend that you use:

PHP 5.6.30 (cli) (built: Feb  7 2017 16:18:37)
Copyright (c) 1997-2016 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.6.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2016 Zend Technologies

    If you are not sure what you are running, try writing `php -v` in the
    command line.

There is currently no persistent storage engine, but you can use whatever you
find appropriate.
